<h2>Are there special circumstances where WSP* should be allowed even when ES is not allowed?</h2>

<div class="message">
<p><span class="author">Added by <a href="../../../users/62.html">Steve Hanson</a> <a href="https://redmine.ogf.org/projects/editor-pubcomarchive/activity?from=2013-09-25" title="09/25/2013 06:36 AM">about 9 years</a> ago</span></p>
<div class="wiki">
<p>Does it ever make sense to allow WSP* as a terminator in non-delimited scenarios? IBM DFDL has some test cases that exploit this, and at least one IBM end user has used WSP* in a  list of values to model an optional terminator. WTX allows their equivalent &lt;OWSP&gt; entity to be used on its own, but say that their "stopping syntax" does not look for "nothing" so actual white space would need to be present - in other words its the same as if &lt;WSP&gt; had been used. Need to consider whether not allowing WSP* makes a conceptually simple format hard to model as regular expressions etc need to be resorted to.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>If we allow WSP* on its own in DFDL 1.0, I think it must be on the grounds that it keeps the modeling of a simple problem simple, for example, to consume optional leading and trailing white space in an intuitive way without having to resort to regexs. I feel that there are indeed such scenarios, and that IBM has customers who are likely exploiting this already. I am consequently wary about disallowing this.</p>


	<p>If we do allow then it some rules must apply to give sensible behaviour.</p>


	<p>1) dfdl:initiator: WSP* on its own disallowed when dfdl:initiatedContent is 'yes'</p>


	<p>2) dfdl:terminator: WSP* on its own is treated like WSP+ when scanning for delimiters, but like WSP* when consuming</p>


	<p>3) dfdl:separator: WSP* on its own is treated like WSP+ when scanning for delimiters, but like WSP* when consuming</p>


	<p>4) dfdl:textStandardZeroRep: WSP* on its own disallowed (have defaulting for empty case)</p></div>

	<p>drop 2 and 3 above. Keep 1 and 4.</p>


	<p>Clarify that WSP* is not allowed as a delimiter when determining the length of an element by scanning for delimiters.</p>

	<p>I think that the updated 2) and 3) can be expressed as follows:</p>


	<p>2) dfdl:terminator: WSP* on its own is disallowed when an element has dfdl:lengthKind 'delimited' or has a child element (recursively) that has dfdl:lengthKind 'delimited'.</p>


	<p>3) dfdl:separator: as per dfdl:terminator</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Point 2 is not quite right. This recursion is interrupted if an element of complex type with specified length appears between the parent having WSP* as a delimiter, and the contained child having lengthKind delimited. Furthermore, if the child has its own terminator, then that IS the delimiter, and WSP* wouldn't even be considered in scope for it. If the child is contained inside a group with a terminator, then depending on the location of the child in that group, that terminator may be required to appear before the WSP* and so the WSP* wouldn't be in scope for it.</p>


	<p>In other words, it's complicated. We don't want to have to reiterate everything about delimiters and which are in scope for a lengthKind delimited element here.</p>


	<p>Possible wording "..... has a a child element having delimited length nested within such that this WSP* delimiter may be needed to determine its length". But I am not sure it is worth trying to keep 2. It sounds more precise than the more general: WSP* is not allowed as a delimiter when determining the length of an element by scanning for delimiters.</p></div>
