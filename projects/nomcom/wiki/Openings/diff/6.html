h1. Job Descriptions  <br /><br /> h3. OGF President <br /><br /> The OGF President is responsible for ensuring that the OGF contributes to the overall evolution of distributed computing architecture and technologies. In that context, the OGF President officially represents the organization, to align OGF activities with other SDOs, relevant organizations and groups. <br /><br /> In addition, the OGF President may arrange for topical or regional workshops attended by the OGF and perhaps other experts in the field.    The OGF President works with the OGF Board in areas regarding long-term strategy for GGF. <br /><br /> h3. Vice President Standards (VP-Standards) <br /><br /> The VP-Standards is responsible for ensuring that the OGF research groups and working groups produce coherent, coordinated, architecturally consistent, and timely output as a contribution to the overall evolution of Grid architecture and technologies.    The VP-Standards oversees the content of the OGF activities, working with the GFSG to manage the creation of new working groups, research groups, or areas and in some cases encouraging the formation of a group rather than waiting for proposals.    The VP-Standards serves as chair of the GFSG, and as such is responsible for guiding the group to consensus and making operational decisions based on this consensus, while taking into account input from other sources, including group chairs, OGF President, OGF Board, the OGF Secretariat, and individual OGF participants.    The VP-Standards works with the GFSG to ensure that working groups and research groups receive adequate assistance from area directors and other GFSG members. 
<br />  
<br /> The VP-Standards also works with the OGF editor to ensure smooth operation of the document process, and in particular to oversee the review function of the process, which is the responsibility of the GFSG. <br /><br /> h3. Vice President Events (VP-Events) <br /><br /> The VP-Events works with the OGF Secretariat to oversee the planning and management of one or more OGF meetings and to ensure that the OGF Web representation of that/those events is kept up to date.    As such, the role of the VP-Events has a limited temporal scope, and OGF may have multiple VP-Events at any time. <br /><br /> h3. Area Director (AD) <br /><br /> The GFSG is composed of Area Directors and other senior members of the OGF community. The GFSG, chaired by the VP-Standards, oversees and coordinates the activities of working groups and research groups. The GFSG meets face-to-face at all OGF at-large meetings and holds regular teleconference meetings.  
<br /> 
<br /> The GFSG is responsible for the OGF document series from the standpoint of architectural and technical quality and coherency, working with the OGF Editor to this end. The GFSG role in the document series process is described in [5]  
<br /> 
<br /> Each AD is assigned a number of groups, for whose guidance and mentoring the AD is responsible.    The AD works with the chairs of the groups to guide the group formation process for proposed working groups and research groups, coordinate the work done by those groups, and oversee the document process as it relates to these groups. <br /><br /> h1. Call for Nomincations for Open Grid Forum Positions <br /><br /> The Open Grid Forum (OGF) Nominations Committee (NOMCOM) is    soliciting nominations for open positions as Open Grid Forum positions. These positions need to be filled to ensure the continued functioning of the OGF Standards function. <br /><br /> All members of the OGF are eligible to stand for these positions and are encouraged to do so.    You can submit your candidate nominations to nomcom@ogf.org or to any of the NOMCOM members listed further below. Self-nominations are accepted and encouraged! <br /><br /> h3. Positions: <br /><br /> There are positions open in the following areas: <br /><br /> * OGF President (1 position) 
<br /> * Vice President - Standards (1 position) 
<br /> * Vice President - Events for OGF-43, OGF-44, OGF-45 (1 position each) 
<br /> * Area Directors, preferable with focus on Data Management, Clouds, and Federation, but also open at-large (multiple positions) <br /><br /> You can get further information about the positions, the requirements for the positions and the selection process by sending an email to nomcom@ogf.org with your questions. Further information is also available at <span class="diff_in">http://redmine.ogf.org/projects/nomcom/wiki/Openings.</span> <span class="diff_out"> http://www.ogf.org/nomcom/.</span> <br /><br /> Terms begin as soon as possible and last for two years.    Terms can be extended. <br /><br /> ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED TO NOMCOM WILL BE KEPT IN CONFIDENCE AND   
<br /> WILL BE USED ONLY DURING DELIBERATIONS OF THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE. <br /><br /> h3. NOMCOM Committee members: <br /><br /> Inder Monga (imonga@es.net) 
<br /> Freek Dijkstra (Freek.Dijkstra@sara.nl) 
<br /> Andre Merzky (andre@merzky.net) <br /><br />
